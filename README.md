Web-dev:

For testing out the websites homepage and account control, first install django, recommend following our guide in th doc or simply check django's doc page, once that's finished goto terminal and do "runserver manage.py" in the first webdev directory.

For testing out the graphing from sql db, first you need to pull grpahos from git ,ascend to the graphos master directory and then next demo_project driectory within that.Replace files from the demo_project/demo folder with files provided on our git and the gchart.html in the templates folder with this own as well, and again do a "runserver manage.py", refer to my video for the files essential for manipulating graphs and the sql database.

if for some reason the django debugger isn't recognizing a module you most make sure that it is listed in the modules section in the settings.py within the respective directory. if not add th emodule name to that list and update ( more information about udating website modules and really anything is on the django docs page)
